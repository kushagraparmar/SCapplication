                        <p>This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which the Institutes collects, uses,
                            maintains and discloses information collected from users (each, a “Student”) of the
                            Institutes. This Privacy Policy applies to the Institutes and all Courses offered by
                            the Institutes.<br><br><strong>Personal identification information</strong></p>
                        <p>We may collect personal identification information from Students in a variety of
                            ways, including, but not limited to, when Students enroll in the Institutes or a
                            Course within the Institutes, subscribe to a newsletter, and in connection with

                            identification information from Students only if they voluntarily submit such
                            information to us. Students can refuse to supply personal identification information
                            but doing so may prevent them from engaging in certain Institutes related
                            activities.</p>
